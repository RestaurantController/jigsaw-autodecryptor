# jigsaw-autodecryptor
Scans all files and decrypts all files encrypted by Jigsaw
<br>
I know there are a lot of decryptors for Jigsaw but this takes it to a new level. It automatically scans the encrypted files list and decrypts all files.
<br>
<h1>Using the decryptor</h1>
It's pretty easy to use the decryptor. Just open the downloaded decryptor, enter the file extension used and wait a few minutes. The program might get unresponsive during encryption but that's normal.
<br>
You can download the decryptor in Releases.
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> You need the encrypted files list otherwise it won't be able to get the encrypted files. Also, the encryption password must be Jigsaw's default encryption password(OoIsAwwF23cICQoLDA0ODe==).
<br>
You will need .NET Framework to run this software.
<br>
UPDATE: Sorry, the program's name was supposed to be Decryptor not Decrypter. I will fix that spelling in a new release.
